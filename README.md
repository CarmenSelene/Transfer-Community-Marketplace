## Transfer Community Marketplace
### [MERN Stack Demo] MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js

Our app helps connect communities by creating local markets centered around subway stops. Log in to the app to see if your neighbour is selling muffins today, or to pick up a used Xbox for $20 two blocks down. Save money, make money, *connect* with your community.

This app is a full-stack MERN application By Saryn Caister and Pavani Vithala.
